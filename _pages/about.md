I am an assistant professor of computer science at UCLA. I lead the [Machine Intelligence (MINT) group](/group/members), where we develop AI systems that can interact and reason with limited supervision. My [current research](/publications) is at the intersection of generative models and sequential decision making. On the applied side, I actively ground this research for developing systems and software for data-driven scientific discovery, particularly in climate and sustainability domains via the [ML4Climate](/group/ml4climate) initiative.


Before joining UCLA, I spent a gap year as a research scientist in the Core ML team at FAIR, Meta. I completed my postdoctoral training at UC Berkeley (advisor: Pieter Abbeel), PhD at Stanford University (advisor: Stefano Ermon) and bachelors at IIT Delhi (co-advisors: Mausam, Parag Singla), all in computer science. 
During my PhD, I spent wonderful summers interning at Google Brain, Microsoft Research, and OpenAI.
