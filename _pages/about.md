I am an assistant professor of computer science at UCLA. I lead the [Machine Intelligence (MINT) group](/group/members), where we develop AI systems that can interact and reason with limited supervision. My [current research](/publications) is at the intersection of generative models, reinforcement learning, and applications to scientific discovery.

I am also the co-founder and CTO of [Inception](https://www.inceptionlabs.ai/), a generative AI startup developing a new generation of ultra-fast, parallel LLMs based on diffusion.

<!-- On the applied side, I actively ground this research for developing systems for scientific discovery, particularly in climate and sustainability domains via the [ML4Climate](/group/ml4climate) initiative. -->

Previously, I spent a gap year as a research scientist at the Fundamental AI Research (FAIR) Group at Meta. I completed my postdoctoral training at UC Berkeley, PhD at Stanford University, and bachelors at IIT Delhi, all in computer science.
During my PhD, I have also spent time working at Google Deepmind, Microsoft Research, and OpenAI.
