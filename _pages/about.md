I am an assistant professor of computer science at UCLA. I lead the [Machine Intelligence (MINT) group](/group/members), where we develop AI systems that can interact and reason with limited supervision. My current research is at the intersection of generative models and sequential decision making, and their application for scientific reasoning. I also ground this research via the [ML4Climate](/group/ml4climate) initiative, where we develop data-driven methods and software to accelerate scientific discovery for climate change applications.


Before joining UCLA, I spent a gap year as a research scientist in the Core ML team at FAIR in Meta. Previously, I completed my postdoctoral training at UC Berkeley (advisor: Pieter Abbeel), PhD at Stanford University (advisor: Stefano Ermon) and bachelors at IIT Delhi (co-advisors: Mausam, Parag Singla), all in computer science. 
During my PhD, I spent wonderful summers interning at Google Brain, Microsoft Research, and OpenAI.
