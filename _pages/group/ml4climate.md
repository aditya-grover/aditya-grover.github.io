<!-- Climate change is the defining challenge for the future of human civilization. For many decades, data-driven solutions have been a key component for understanding climate science, and efforts in mitigating and adapting to climate change. However, data science is undergoing a paradigm shift, driven in large by the development of modern generative AI systems that can play complex games, write stories, generate art, and much more.   -->

The [MINT group](https://aditya-grover.github.io/group/members) works with a range of external collaborators to pioneer the next generation of generative machine learning system that will inform the science, technology, and policy in mitigating and adapting to a changing climate. Our work broadly centers on three pillars at the intersection of artificial intelligence and climate change.

- **Research:** We regularly publish papers at the frontiers of artificial intelligence and climate change. Our current focus areas are in physical sciences. See representative works papers [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10343) and [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-1994-5).

- **Engineering:** We develop and maintain [dataset benchmarks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00712) and [software](https://github.com/aditya-grover/climate-learn) for accelerating research and engineering efforts.

- **Education and Outreach:** We develop accessible courses, [tutorials](https://www.climatechange.ai/papers/neurips2022/114) and [seminar talks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCQa3EDAK_s) to onboard students, researchers, and practitioners with different backgrounds. We organize [events](https://ai4climatescience.github.io/) that engage diverse stakeholders.

- ClimaX also wins **best paper award** at ICML Workshop on Synergy of Scientific and Machine Learning Modeling which will take place right after the main conference. Congrats Tung!

- ClimaX accepted for publication at ICML main conference. See you in Hawaii!

- Tung and Aditya, along with collaborators from Microsoft, recently released [ClimaX](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10343), the first foundation model for weather and climate. We are excited by the [public](https://twitter.com/tungnd_13/status/1618642574427959296) and [press](https://www.marktechpost.com/2023/01/29/microsoft-research-introduces-climax-a-flexible-and-generalizable-deep-learning-model-for-weather-and-climate-science/) so far, and have many interesting followups in store.

- We launched our PyTorch library [ClimateLearn](/blog/2023/climate-learn/) and humbled by the [public response](https://twitter.com/adityagrover_/status/1613975759206625281?s=20) so far.

- Aditya is chairing the [AI4ClimateScience Bridge Program](https://ai4climatescience.github.io/) at AAAI on Feb 8, 2022.

- Hritik, Tung, Shashank, and Aditya presented a tutorial on [ML for predicting Climate Extremes](https://www.climatechange.ai/papers/neurips2022/114) at NeurIPS 2022 workshop on Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning. Selected for spotlight!
