Climate change is the defining challenge for the future of human civilization. For many decades, data-driven solutions have been a key component for understanding climate science, and efforts in mitigating and adapting to climate change. However, data science is undergoing a paradigm shift, driven in large by the development of modern machine learning systems that can play complex games, write stories, generate art, and much more.  What's in store for climate change research?

In the ML4Climate initiative, the members of [MINT group](https://aditya-grover.github.io/group/) work with a range of external collaborators to pioneer the next generation of machine learning algorithms and frameworks that will inform the science, technology, and policy in mitigating and adapting to the changing climate. Our work broadly centers on 3 pillars at the intersection of artificial intelligence and climate change.

* **Research:** We regularly publish papers at the frontiers of artificial intelligence and climate change. Our current focus areas are in climate science and sustainable energy. See representative works papers [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10343) and [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-1994-5).

* **Software:** We believe in open and reproducible science. Not just doing it, but enabling it. We develop and maintain [dataset benchmarks and software](https://github.com/aditya-grover/climate-learn) for pushing data-driven climate science.

* **Education and Outreach:** We develop accessible courses and [tutorials](https://www.climatechange.ai/papers/neurips2022/114) to onboard students, researchers, and practitioners with different backgrounds. We write [blog articles](/blog/) for broader audiences, and organize [events](https://ai4climatescience.github.io/) that engage diverse stakeholders.


# news

* Thank you [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2023/09/21/hurricane-lee-artificial-intelligence-forecasting/), [MIT Tech Review](https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/11/14/1083366/google-deepminds-weather-ai-can-forecast-extreme-weather-quicker-and-more-accurately/) for covering our research on ClimaX. Aditya's comments on the field more broadly appeared in [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03552-y) and [Science](https://www.science.org/content/article/ai-churns-out-lightning-fast-forecasts-good-weather-agencies).


* ClimateLearn [v1](https://github.com/aditya-grover/climate-learn) and [benchmark preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01909) released!

* Aditya gave keynote talks on ClimaX and ClimateLearn at Hydro ML Conference, KDD Environment Day, and UCSD Scientific ML Symposium, seminar talks at Columbia, Argonne National Lab, UT Austin,  and Sony.

* Tung invited to give a seminar talk on ClimaX at Leeds SciML Seminar.

* ClimaX also wins **best paper award** at ICML Workshop on Synergy of Scientific and Machine Learning Modeling which will take place right after the main conference. Congrats Tung!

* ClimaX accepted for publication at ICML main conference. See you in Hawaii! 

* Tung and Aditya, along with collaborators from Microsoft, recently released [ClimaX](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10343), the first foundation model for weather and climate. We are excited by the [public](https://twitter.com/tungnd_13/status/1618642574427959296) and [press](https://www.marktechpost.com/2023/01/29/microsoft-research-introduces-climax-a-flexible-and-generalizable-deep-learning-model-for-weather-and-climate-science/) so far, and have many interesting followups in store.

* We launched our PyTorch library [ClimateLearn](/blog/2023/climate-learn/) and humbled by the [public response](https://twitter.com/adityagrover_/status/1613975759206625281?s=20) so far.

* Aditya is chairing the [AI4ClimateScience Bridge Program](https://ai4climatescience.github.io/) at AAAI on Feb 8, 2022. 

* Hritik, Tung, Shashank, and Aditya presented a tutorial on [ML for predicting Climate Extremes](https://www.climatechange.ai/papers/neurips2022/114) at NeurIPS 2022 workshop on Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning. Selected for spotlight!
