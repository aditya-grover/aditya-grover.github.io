  title={Leaving Reality to Imagination: Robust Classification via Generated Datasets},
  author={Bansal, Hritik and Grover, Aditya},
  journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:2302.02503},
  abstract={Recent research on robustness has revealed significant performance gaps between neural image classifiers trained on datasets that are similar to the test set, and those that are from a naturally shifted distribution, such as sketches, paintings, and animations of the object categories observed during training. Prior work focuses on reducing this gap by designing engineered augmentations of training data or through unsupervised pretraining of a single large model on massive in-the-wild training datasets scraped from the Internet. However, the notion of a dataset is also undergoing a paradigm shift in recent years. With drastic improvements in the quality, ease-of-use, and access to modern generative models, generated data is pervading the web. In this light, we study the question: How do these generated datasets influence the natural robustness of image classifiers? We find that Imagenet classifiers trained on real data augmented with generated data achieve higher accuracy and effective robustness than standard training and popular augmentation strategies in the presence of natural distribution shifts. We analyze various factors influencing these results, including the choice of conditioning strategies and the amount of generated data. Lastly, we introduce and analyze an evolving generated dataset, ImageNet-G-v1, to better benchmark the design, utility, and critique of standalone generated datasets for robust and trustworthy machine learning.},

  title={Reliable Conditioning of Behavioral Cloning for Offline Reinforcement Learning},
  author={Nguyen, Tung and Zheng, Qinqing and Grover, Aditya},

  pdf={https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05158},
  abstract={Behavioral cloning (BC) provides a straightforward solution to offline RL by mimicking offline trajectories via supervised learning. Recent advances (Chen et al., 2021; Janner et al., 2021; Emmons et al., 2021) have shown that by conditioning on desired future returns, BC can perform competitively to their value-based counterparts, while enjoying much more simplicity and training stability. While promising, we show that these methods can be unreliable, as their performance may degrade significantly when conditioned on high, out-of-distribution (ood) returns. This is crucial in practice, as we often expect the policy to perform better than the offline dataset by conditioning on an ood value. We show that this unreliability arises from both the suboptimality of training data and model architectures. We propose ConserWeightive Behavioral Cloning (CWBC), a simple and effective method for improving the reliability of conditional BC with two key components: trajectory weighting and conservative regularization. Trajectory weighting upweights the high-return trajectories to reduce the train-test gap for BC methods, while conservative regularizer encourages the policy to stay close to the data distribution for ood conditioning. We study CWBC in the context of RvS (Emmons et al., 2021) and Decision Transformers (Chen et al., 2021), and show that CWBC significantly boosts their performance on various benchmarks.},

  author={Nguyen, Tung and Jewik, Jason and Bansal, Hritik and Sharma, Prakhar and Grover, Aditya},

  abstract={Modeling weather and climate is an essential endeavor to understand the near- and long-term impacts of climate change, as well as inform technology and policymaking for adaptation and mitigation efforts. In recent years, there has been a surging interest in applying data-driven methods based on machine learning for solving core problems such as weather forecasting and climate downscaling. Despite promising results, much of this progress has been impaired due to the lack of large-scale, open-source efforts for reproducibility, resulting in the use of inconsistent or underspecified datasets, training setups, and evaluations by both domain scientists and artificial intelligence researchers. We introduce ClimateLearn, an open-source PyTorch library that vastly simplifies the training and evaluation of machine learning models for data-driven climate science. ClimateLearn consists of holistic pipelines for dataset processing (e.g., ERA5, CMIP6, PRISM), implementation of state-of-the-art deep learning models (e.g., Transformers, ResNets), and quantitative and qualitative evaluation for standard weather and climate modeling tasks. We supplement these functionalities with extensive documentation, contribution guides, and quickstart tutorials to expand access and promote community growth. We have also performed comprehensive forecasting and downscaling experiments to showcase the capabilities and key features of our library. To our knowledge, ClimateLearn is the first large-scale, open-source effort for bridging research in weather and climate modeling with modern machine learning systems. Our library is available publicly at https://github.com/aditya-grover/climate-learn},

@article{zhao2023decision,
  title={Decision Stacks: Flexible Reinforcment Learning Via Modular Generative Models},
  author={Zhao, Siyan and Grover, Aditya},
  journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:2306.06253},
  pdf={https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06253},
  abstract={Reinforcement learning provides a compelling approach for tackling various aspects of sequential decision making, such as defining complex goals, planning future actions and observations, and evaluating their utilities. However, effectively integrating these capabilities while maintaining both expressive power and flexibility in modeling choices poses significant algorithmic challenges for efficient learning and inference. In this work, we introduce Decision Stacks, a generative framework that decomposes goal-conditioned policy agents into three distinct generative modules. These modules utilize independent generative models to simulate the temporal evolution of observations, rewards, and actions, enabling parallel learning through teacher forcing. Our framework ensures both expressivity and flexibility by allowing designers to tailor individual modules to incorporate architectural bias, optimization objectives, dynamics, domain transferability, and inference speed. Through extensive empirical evaluations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of Decision Stacks in offline policy optimization across various Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) and Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs), outperforming existing methods and facilitating flexible generative decision making.},
