  title={Leaving Reality to Imagination: Robust Classification via Generated Datasets},

  abstract={Recent research on robustness has revealed significant performance gaps between neural image classifiers trained on datasets that are similar to the test set, and those that are from a naturally shifted distribution, such as sketches, paintings, and animations of the object categories observed during training. Prior work focuses on reducing this gap by designing engineered augmentations of training data or through unsupervised pretraining of a single large model on massive in-the-wild training datasets scraped from the Internet. However, the notion of a dataset is also undergoing a paradigm shift in recent years. With drastic improvements in the quality, ease-of-use, and access to modern generative models, generated data is pervading the web. In this light, we study the question: How do these generated datasets influence the natural robustness of image classifiers? We find that Imagenet classifiers trained on real data augmented with generated data achieve higher accuracy and effective robustness than standard training and popular augmentation strategies in the presence of natural distribution shifts. We analyze various factors influencing these results, including the choice of conditioning strategies and the amount of generated data. Lastly, we introduce and analyze an evolving generated dataset, ImageNet-G-v1, to better benchmark the design, utility, and critique of standalone generated datasets for robust and trustworthy machine learning.},

  title={Reliable Conditioning of Behavioral Cloning for Offline Reinforcement Learning},
  author={Nguyen, Tung and Zheng, Qinqing and Grover, Aditya},

  abstract={Behavioral cloning (BC) provides a straightforward solution to offline RL by mimicking offline trajectories via supervised learning. Recent advances (Chen et al., 2021; Janner et al., 2021; Emmons et al., 2021) have shown that by conditioning on desired future returns, BC can perform competitively to their value-based counterparts, while enjoying much more simplicity and training stability. While promising, we show that these methods can be unreliable, as their performance may degrade significantly when conditioned on high, out-of-distribution (ood) returns. This is crucial in practice, as we often expect the policy to perform better than the offline dataset by conditioning on an ood value. We show that this unreliability arises from both the suboptimality of training data and model architectures. We propose ConserWeightive Behavioral Cloning (CWBC), a simple and effective method for improving the reliability of conditional BC with two key components: trajectory weighting and conservative regularization. Trajectory weighting upweights the high-return trajectories to reduce the train-test gap for BC methods, while conservative regularizer encourages the policy to stay close to the data distribution for ood conditioning. We study CWBC in the context of RvS (Emmons et al., 2021) and Decision Transformers (Chen et al., 2021), and show that CWBC significantly boosts their performance on various benchmarks.},
